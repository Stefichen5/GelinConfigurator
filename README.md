# gelin_configurator

Goal of this project is to aid GELin users with creating and configuring their projects. I wrote this tool in my spare time. I do not have any affiliation with Ginzinger electronic systems.

I am not a UI/UX designer and thus the interface might look a little bit rough and not as aesthetically pleasing or intuitive as would be ideal.

Feel free to use it if you wish. However, I do not guarantee that it will work, do what you want or does not destroy your computer. Use at your own risk.

## What is GELin?

GELin is a "Linux building toolkit" by Ginzinger Electronics which is focused on ease of use and abstracting many of the system builder hassles from the developer, so the developer can focus on their business logic and applications. You can find more information about GELin [here](https://www.ginzinger.com/en/technologien/embedded-linux/).
